Welcome to my music theory app.

This app's tech stack is SwiftUI for front-end user interface, swift for the logic of the app, and SQLite as the back-end database.

This app is now out on the app store! If you are interested in learning more about music theory for beginners please download it here: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/beginner-theory/id6740189179?uo=2

The goal of the app is to teach fundamental music theory concepts such as the circle of fourths, intervals, scales, chords, and harmony.
