Welcome to my music theory app.

This app's tech stack is SwiftUI for front-end user interface, swift for the logic of the app, and SQLite as the back-end database.

The app is currently being deployed on the iOS app store and will be out by the end of January. It will be called Beginner Theory.

The goal of the app is to teach fundamental music theory concepts such as the circle of fourths, intervals, scales, chords, and harmony.
